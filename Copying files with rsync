The cp command is used to copy files between directories, but it has not an option to see the copy progress.
So, to see the progress status we can use the rsync command as follow:

rsync -vP fileToTransfer /directoryOfDestiny

Important to notice that rsync command can be used to copy files into to the local system or to a remote system.
