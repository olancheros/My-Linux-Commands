Performing a batch rename with a loop <<for>> in a Linux terminal

for filename in FILE*; do echo mv \"$filename\" \"${filename//FILE/NEW_NAME}\"; done

The above command allows us to check if the file rename is getting as expected. So review the result
and if you are confident that the command did not mess anything up, then you can pipe it directly to /bin/bash

for filename in FILE*; do echo mv \"$filename\" \"${filename//FILE/NEW_NAME}\"; done | /bin/bash
