One day, while working I had hundreds of text files that were composed of a bunch of variable prefixes but with a constant suffix.
My challenge was to update the suffix in those files. So in order to get rid of that task in an automatic way, I did use the following command line

find -name "*fileName*.txt" -print | xargs sed -i "s/old_suffix_text/new_suffix_text/g"

Explanation:

1. find -name ==> Looks for all the text files with the pattern (*fileName*.txt).
2. xargs ==> Executes the command (in this case <<sed>>) for each result obtained from <<find>> command.
3. | the pipe ==> Each output form <<find>> command will correspond to the input of <<sed>> command.
4. sed ==> Performs the "search - replace" inside of the text file.
