Sometimes you may need just to read a SEGY file EBCDIC header. To accomplish this task without loading the SEGY file in a SEGY viewer,
we can use the Linux command <<dd>>

<<dd>> is a command-line utility for Unix and Unix-like operating systems whose primary purpose is to convert and copy files.
The <<dd>> program can also perform conversions on the data as it is copied, including byte order swapping and conversion
to and from the ASCII and EBCDIC text encodings.

The SEG-Y format is composed of a 3200-byte Textual file header (EBCDIC), followed by a 400-byte binary header
and followed by a number of variable trace records that are each preceded by a 240-byte Standard Trace Header.

We can read the SEGYs EBCDIC header as follow:

dd if=SEGYFILE.sgy ibs=3200 count=1 conv=ascii | fold

Command explanation:
1. dd ==> Invoque the command
2. if <==> input file
3. ibs <==> input block size
4. count=1 (reads each byte)
5. conv=ascii converts EBCDIC to ASCII
6. | fold allows us to print the text with an 80 column width
